# Server Side Concepts

* You'll find that there's a lot of emphasis on async
* Client
  * a client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server. the server is often (but not always) on another computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of a network. The term applies to programs or devices that are part of a client-server model.
  * the user of a server
  * a consumer of something that a server serves up
* The Client/Server Model
  * the client-server characteristic describes the relationship of cooperating programs in an application. The server component provides a function or server to one of the clients.
* Routing
  * the transformation of a url into some target behavior that satisfies a user's goal. In other words, routing is when you transform a URL the client has requested (based on the pattern it conforms to) to some appropriate routine that the server will use to respond to those requests.
* Daemon
  * In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally daemon names end with the letter D: for example, syslogd is the daemon that implements the system logging facility and sshd is a daemon that services incoming SSH connections.
* Cron
  * The software utility Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. People who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates or intervals. It typically automates system maintenance or administration- though its general purpose nature makes it useful for things like connecting to the Internet and downloading email at regular intervals.
* File I/O
  * Operations that allow the creation, deletion, reading and editing of files in the host file system. File I/O operations are expensive. Unlike other tasks which exploit the speed of in-memory operations, File I/O involves mechanical operations to find and read/write data on a persistent memory store (hard drive). These operations are orders of magnitude more time-consuming than in-memory operations. Consequently, minimizing File I/O or using asynchronous coding or other techniques to prevent them from blocking the Event Loop is an important part of optimizing application performance.
