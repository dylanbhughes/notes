## Shortly Express Town Hall

* Good password schemes vs. Bad Password Schemes
  * If you imagine that we have a user who is not especially creative, pwd = password123
  * Types of Encryption
    * Symmetric Encryption
      * The same key encrypts and decrypts the data
    * Public key Encryption
      * I have one public key that I share with the world, but this key only encrypts data
      * My private key, which is kept secret, is needed to decrypt a message in order to read it
      * Giving out lockboxes and you only have the key. People can put things in the boxes and send them back but they need the lock to be read.
  * A Hash is Different from Encryption because it is meant to be a one-way operation
    * Irreversible
* Getting Started with the Sprint
  * Create a users table

## Solution Town Hall

* No surprises in the model
* Timestamps was a thing
